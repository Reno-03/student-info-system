# STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM

### **Final examination / project in Data Structure and Algorithms**

<br>
The C++ program is a **Student Information System** that is used to manage data such as adding, searching, deleting, saving, and loading the dataset, and sorted, using a text file as a repository. 
<br>
<br>
**Classes (OOP)** were used within this program for a clean, more organized set of functions. The dataset utilizes a **vector**-type of array due to its indexing property, dynamic array size, and quick deletion and addition of data. A customized **structured** data type is used, where one element of the vector array represents one entry, that includes the fields: ID, Last Name, First Name, Age, Gender, and Contact Number. The dataset is sorted using **Merge Sort Algorithm** due to its efficiency and stability property, and the data is searched using **Linear Search Algorithm**. 
<br>
<br>
The dataset is saved and loaded manually using **fstream C++ library**. When the data is about to be saved, the text file will be overwritten. Same goes when we load the data, the dataset within the program will be overwritten by the text file saved.
